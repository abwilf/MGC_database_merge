Steps:
merge info for matching dev_id's or first and last names - DONE
    update alumni
    set

    from dev_db
    where alumni.dev_id = dev_db.dev_id or (alumni.first=dev_db.first_name and alumni.last = dev_db.last_name);



insert names into alumni from dev that don't match with alumni
    insert into one(a, b)
    select two.a, two.b from
    two left join one on
    two.a = one.a
    where one.a is NULL;


    insert into alumni(dev_id, first, last, address, city, state, zip, cell, home, email)

    from
    dev_db left join alumni on
    dev_db.dev_id = alumni.dev_id
    where alumni.dev_id is NULL;


find alumni still missing: (write this to csv)
    select * from alumni where dev_id is NULL;



    TEST: print all alumni where dv_db.A = alumni.A and (alumni.B != dev_db.B || alumni.C != dev_db.C) -> should be nothing!
        select alumni.dev_id from
        alumni inner join dev_db on alumni.dev_id = dev_db.dev_id
        where alumni.last <> dev_db.last_name;
        update alumni where alumni.first = dev.first and alumni.last = dev.last


RESULT 1: print count of alumni matched with dev
    select count(alumni.dev_id) from alumni inner join dev_db on alumni.dev_id = dev_db.dev_id;

    select count(*) from (select distinct * from alumni where last='Cole' or last='Collins') as x;

    select count(*) from (select * from alumni where last='Cole' or last='Collins') as x;

    select count(*) from alumni inner join dev_db on (alumni.last=dev_db.last_name) and (alumni.last='Cole' or alumni.last='Collins');

    select * from alumni inner join dev_db on (alumni.last=dev_db.last_name) and (alumni.last='Cole' or alumni.last='Collins');

    select distinct * from (select alumni.first, alumni.last from alumni inner join dev_db on (alumni.last=dev_db.last_name) and (alumni.last='Cole')) as x;


RESULT 2: print count of alumni matched with dev again
    select count(*) from alumni inner join dev_db on alumni.dev_id = dev_db.dev_id;


TEST: RESULT 2 - RESULT 1 = merge info update count




print all dev w/ same last name to see if there is crossover
    select count(alumni.dev_id) from alumni inner join dev_db on (alumni.last = dev_db.last_name and alumni.dev_id != dev_db.dev_id);

for all leftover in alumni that are not in dev, make separate csv, send to ellen aretakis to check

insert all remaining dev into alumni
